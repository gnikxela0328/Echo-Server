# Echo-Server
--------------------------------------
C Echo server using socket programming
--------------------------------------

This program contains a server and client that can be used to communicate within a host-only 
network. With slight modification, the program can be used over the internet given the proper addressing
and port schema. The default configuration utilizes the host loopback address and port 3000 to facilitate
a tcp connection for call and response.
